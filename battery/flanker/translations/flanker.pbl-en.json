"INST1TEXT": "This study will test how you both use and ignore information in order to make a decision.  In this task, you will be asked to determine the direction of the center arrow, in a set of five.  If it is pointing left, make a LEFT response.  If it is to the right, make a RIGHT response.  The heads of the arrows surrounding the center arrow will either be in same direction, the opposite direction, will be absent, and only appear as lines.  You will always ignore the surrounding symbols, and respond only to the central arrow.  Some example stimuli are shown below.  Make a response to continue.",
"INST3TEXT": "You will start with a short block of practice trials.  After each trial, you will be told whether you are correct, and told how long you took to make the response (in thousandths of a second).  To to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.  Remember, use the LEFT and RIGHT responses as shown below.  Make a response to begin.",
