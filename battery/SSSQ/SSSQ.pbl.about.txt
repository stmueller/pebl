The Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ) is a brief self-report instrument designed to assess transient stress states during task performance. The questionnaire consists of 24 items rated on a 5-point scale from "Not at all" to "Extremely". The SSSQ measures multiple dimensions of task-induced stress including distress, task engagement, worry, and self-focused attention. This implementation presents each item individually and records both ratings and response times.
