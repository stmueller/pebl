On each trial, you will simply need to decide what shape is shown, and make one of two responses. When you see a circle, make a LEFT response.  When you see a square, make a RIGHT response.   Most of the time, the square will appear on the left, and the circle will appear on the right.  Make a response to continue.",

After each trial, you will be told whether you are correct, and told how long you took to make the response (in thousandths of a second).  To to respond as quickly as possible without making any mistakes.  Remember, use the LEFT and RIGHT responses as shown below.  Make a response to begin.",
