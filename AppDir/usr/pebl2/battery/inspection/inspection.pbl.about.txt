The 'inspection' task is a visual search task framed as a screen quality inspection. Participants inspect screens for defects by searching for a cross (formed by intersecting horizontal and vertical lines) among a field of horizontal and vertical line distractors. By default, 1600 lines are arranged in a 32x50 grid within a centered 800x600 pixel field with a rectangle border. Participants press left-shift to REJECT defective screens (cross present) and right-shift to ACCEPT good screens (no cross). The task runs for a fixed duration (default 5 minutes) from the start of the first practice trial. This task measures visual search efficiency and attention.
