  "inst1": "In this task, you will be asked to solve a series of maze puzzles, like the one you see below. Each puzzle will have two phases: a PLANNING PHASE, in which you look at the maze and make a plan for how you will solve it, and a SOLVING PHASE, in which you use the arrow keys on the keyboard to make a path from the start (S) to the end (E). Press the space bar to continue.",
  "inst2": "In the maze, there is only one path from start to finish. During the PLANNING PHASE, do not touch the keyboard, and try to make a plan for how you will solve the maze. Your goal will be to solve it via the shortest path possible, so you should have a pretty good idea of the route before you start solving. Once you have a plan, hit the space bar and use the arrow keys to execute the plan in the SOLVING PHASE. Press the space bar to continue.",
  "inst3": "Remember: 1. take as long as you want to plan. 2. Once you start solving, try to find the shortest path you can, without backtracking or mistakes. 3. Try to solve as quickly as you can, as long as you do not make any mistakes. Let's start with a practice round--plan how you will solve this maze and then hit space bar to begin.",
  "preview": "Press any key to see preview",
  "prompt": "PLANNING PHASE: Press the space bar when you have finished making your plan. Then solve the maze using arrow keys",
  "solving": "SOLVING PHASE: move from S to E using arrow keys on keyboard",
  "debrief": "This part of the study is complete. Press any key to continue."
