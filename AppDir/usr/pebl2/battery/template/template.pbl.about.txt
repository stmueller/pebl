The 'template' task is a comprehensive starting point for creating new PEBL experiments. This is not an actual psychological test, but rather a fully-documented template that includes all standard components of a PEBL battery task: parameter configuration, translation support, practice and test phases, data recording, and extensive inline documentation. Users can copy this template to create new tasks by filling in the TODO sections with task-specific logic. The template demonstrates best practices for PEBL experiment design including proper trial structure, response collection, feedback presentation, and data file management. It is designed to be used with AI/LLM assistance by providing clear documentation and examples of common experimental patterns.
