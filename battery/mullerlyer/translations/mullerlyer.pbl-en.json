"INST1": "In this study, you will see a horizontal line with arrowheads, like the one pictured below. Notice that there is a center set of arrowheads which divides the line roughly in half.  You will be asked to judge which side of the line is longer, to the left of the central arrowhead or to the right.  You should ignore the arrowheads, and look just at the line.  In the example below, the two lines are not the same length, but they may appear to be close. \n\nThere will be a total of <TRIALS> comparisons to make.  Make your decision as quickly and and accurately as possible.  You will make your response by hitting the left and right shift keys.  Press any key to begin.",
