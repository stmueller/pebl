The Mental Rotation Test (MRT) is a spatial visualization task where participants view a target 3D object and must identify which two of four alternative drawings show the same object rotated to different angles. The test includes 4 practice trials with feedback and 24 test trials. Participants must select exactly two matching objects for each problem. This test measures spatial reasoning and mental rotation ability, based on the classic work by Shepard & Metzler (1971) and the paper-and-pencil version by Vandenberg & Kuse (1978).
