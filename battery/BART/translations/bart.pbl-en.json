"INSTRUCTIONS": "Throughout the task, you will be presented with a series of balloons, one at a time. For each balloon you can click on the button labeled 'Press This Button to Pump Up the Balloon' to increase the size of the balloon. You will accumulate 5 cents in a temporary bank for each pump. You will not be shown the amount you have accumulated in your temporary bank. At any point, you can stop pumping up the balloon and click on the button labeled 'Collect $$$'. Clicking this button will start you on the next balloon and will transfer the accumulated money from your temporary bank to your permanent bank labeled 'Total Earned'. The amount you earned on the previous balloon is shown in the box labeled 'Last Balloon'. It is your choice to determine how much to pump up the balloon, but be aware that at some point the balloon will explode. The explosion point varies across balloons ranging from the first pump to enough pumps to make the balloon fill the entire computer screen. If the balloon explodes before you click on 'Collect $$$', then you move on to the next balloon and all money in your temporary bank is lost. Exploded balloons do not affect the money accumulated in your permanent bank. At the end of the task, you will receive gift certificates in the amount earned in your permanent bank.  Press any key to begin.",
