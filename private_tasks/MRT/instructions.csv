inst1,"Please look at these five figures. Note that these are all pictures of the same object which is shown from different angles. Try to imagine moving the object (or yourself with respect to the object), as you look from one drawing to the next."
inst2,Here are two drawings of a new figure that is different from the one shown in the first 5 drawings. Satisfy yourself that these two drawings show an object that is different and cannot be rotated to be identical with the object shown in the first five drawings.
inst3,"Now look at the object on the left. Two of the four drawings on the right show the same object. Can you find those two? Click to select both of them. If you make a mistake, click on the one you meant and a checkmark will move."
inst4,The first and third drawings are correct.
inst5,"Now you will do three more practice problems. Again, the target object is shown twice in each set of four alternatives from which you choose the correct ones. Choose the two correct items for each problem."
inst6,"You will now do 10 test problems.  You will have 3 minutes to complete these. Your time limit is shown on the red timer bar in the bottom center of the screen.  When you do the test, please remember that for each problem set there are two and only two figures that match the target figure. You will only be given a point if you mark off both correct matching figures, marking off only one of these will result in no marks."
inst7,"Please take a short (1-minute) break.  Next, you will do another 10 problems, and you will have another 3 minutes to complete them.  Remember that for each problem set there are two and only two figures that match the target figure. You will only be given a point if you mark off both correct matching figures, marking off only one of these will result in no marks."
inst8,This part of the testing is complete. You got <total> out of 24 problems right. Click the mouse button to continue.
