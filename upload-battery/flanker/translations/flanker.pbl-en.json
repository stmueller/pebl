"INST1TEXT": "This study will test how you both use and ignore information in order to make a decision.  In this task, you will be asked to determine the direction of the center arrow, in a set of five.  If it is pointing left, press the LEFT response key.  If it is to the right, press the RIGHT response key.  The heads of the arrows surrounding the center arrow will either be in same direction, the opposite direction, will be absent, and only appear as lines.  You will always ignore the surrounding symbols, and respond only to the central arrow.  Some example stimuli are shown below.  Press any key to continue.",
"INST3TEXT": "You will start with a short block of practice trials.  After each trial, you will be told whether you are correct, and told how long you took to make the response (in thousandths of a second).  To to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.  Remember, use the LEFT and RIGHT response keys to respond.  Press any key to begin.",
