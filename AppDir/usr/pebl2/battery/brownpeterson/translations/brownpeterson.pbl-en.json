At the beginning of each trial, you will see a set of three consonants, followed shortly by a number.  Please read the consonants out loud, then await the number. You are to repeat the number immediately after I say it and begin counting backwards by 3's from that number in time with the ticking that you hear. You might see ABC then the number 309. Say ABC immediately after you see it, then once you see 309, you say 309, 306, 303, etc., until you are cued to recall.  Try to count in time to the beep, giving a response every other beep.  When this happens, stop counting immediately and enter the letters that were given at the beginning of the trial. Remember to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. We will start with a few practice trials.",
