The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is a standardized instrument for measuring the discomfort and adverse effects experienced during or after exposure to virtual environments, simulators, or other immersive technologies. The questionnaire consists of 28 symptoms rated on a 4-point scale from "None" to "Severe". Symptoms are grouped into three subscales: nausea, oculomotor disturbance, and disorientation. This implementation presents each symptom individually and records both the severity rating and response time for each item.
