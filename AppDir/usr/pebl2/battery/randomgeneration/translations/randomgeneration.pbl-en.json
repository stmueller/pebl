"INST1": "In this task, you should press a keyboard number (0-9) repeatedly, once for each beep and flash. Try to make the numbers you press in as random an order as possible. For example, think about picking a number out of a hat, typing that number, putting it back, and then picking another.  Keep a consistent response rhythm, responding once per beep and flash.",
"INST2": "There will be a red circle that flashes on the screen to help you keep time.  When the computer registers your response, the red circle will be replaced by white empty circle.  Try to make a response for each flash.",
"INST3": "To take part, place you fingers on the number line at the top of the keyboard, with your index finders on 4 and 7.  Although 5 and 6 will not be directly below a finger, use all ten numbers equally often.",

"TESTINST": "Now, you will be tested for real, and your responses will be recorded.  Remember to enter one number for each flash on the screen.  Hit OK to begin."
