"INST1": "In this task, you will see a pattern drawn on the grid.  It will be shown for a couple seconds, and then disappear.  Once it disappears, you need to try to reproduce it exactly as it appears, from start to end, in a single line.  To do this, click on the starting location, move your cursor along the path you remember while you are holding the mouse button down, then release the mouse button when you are finished. Try to draw exactly where the line is--if you make the same shape but in a different location, that is considered an error. There is no backtracking or editing allowed.  Hit OK to begin.",
"FOOTER1": "Press mouse button to start--release to finish",
"FOOTER2": "Try to reproduce exact position of path",
"SPACE": "Hit space bar to see path",
"TODRAW": "Click to draw path.",
