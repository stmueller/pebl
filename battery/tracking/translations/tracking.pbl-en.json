"INST1": "On this task, you try to move your mouse to a location, or follow a moving object.  At times, it will be easy.  Other times, it will be more difficult, because when you move your mouse one way, it will move the cursor in a different direction.  In those situations, you should try to learn the new mapping--don't try to change the direction the mouse is pointing in to compensate.  At first, you will be bad, but you should improve with practice.  Press OK to begin a practice trial.",
"INST2": "First, we will start with a simple tracking task with normal mouse mapping. Follow the red target with your mouse.  Press OK to begin.",
"INST3": "Now, you do a trial with a different mapping.  Try to track the target as closely as you can. ",
"INST4": "You will do another trial with the same mapping as the previous trial.  Press OK to begin.",
"DEBRIEF": "This test is complete.  Press OK to continue.",
