----- Post 2.1:


* Fix toh because when you use a move limit, the thermometer ends up on top of the display, probably for some but not all screen sizes.


integrate lab streaming layer:
https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer
-stringsplit in symmetryspan and ospan; -> splitstring

* right now setting text with a number causes an error. We should be more forgiving here.

* document how you can specify the separator character in FilePRintList and maybe printlist
* popupentrybox breaks on black background; should allow larger entry box and 
  font should be light if background is dark.

Bug reports from Damon Lamb:



Good morning Shane,


We finally had time to look further into this and managed to track down at least one issue which appears to fix one of the problems in the launcher with regard to the subject ID not being passed to the individual tests: lin
e 433 


Broadly, the issue appears to be one with overlapping/inconsistent naming of variables, in the case gsubnum, gSubCode, etc.


I hope that's helpful for others, too.


Damon


 

Good afternoon Shane,

I hope you had a nice trip (I'm assuming that is why you were out of town)!

I'll try generating a new batch file with 2.1 and then dig into it to see where it's kicking it off. When I checked earlier it looked fine, but perhaps I missed that it was the wrong version. 

I hadn't looked at the customlauncher.pbl file at all, I'll do so when I next can get onto the experimental computer.

For now, I've been manually editing the config file prior to each subject. It is far from ideal, but at least it works.

Thanks,

Damon

---------------------------------------------------------------



-standalone still doesn't handle experiment chains right!

-document change to WaitForClickOnTargetWithTimeout (new button arguments)

- Fix 2.0 betas so they have the two translations in the tapping test.

-gonogo seems to have the opposite second block that the paper it is based on does.



- tapping.pbl translations files may not be included in windows
ROTATION - translations/Rotation.pbl-en.csv
TOWER OF HANOI (TOH) - translations/TOH.pbl-en.csv



three new ratings scales from Brandon
-fix flanker arrows just like ANT arrows.

- 5-10 translation files in translations-pending\ directory here


From Adam Raikes (adam.raikes@gmail.com; 
    Last thing... I intend to use the color stroop as part of my battery (including this likert survey). I was looking at the summary output and it is assigning errors as all random errors. Part of the issue, I think, is that the english translation file has the sequence 1= red, 2 = blue, 3 = green, 4 = yellow. This is how it reads in line 838 (gColorNames = ...). However, lines 523, 524, 561, 562, 602, and 603 assign them backwards (e.g. green <- Nth(gColorNames,2) means that green <- "blue"). I'm still working on debugging because even when fixed, it doesn't produce the correct error summary.
--fixed the missing assignment



 Documentation for new messagebox,countdown optional arguments
 documentation for MakeTable()
 

TODO for 0.15
gonogo task--needs correct column; dprime, etc.
reading span--needs summary score (accuracy for both tasks)


Push to 2.0+
------------------------------------------
SL translation of mental rotation task (see help forum)

sdl_rtf???
*RTL font rendering? (look into harfbuzz)

SaveBMP function???

-relative mouse mode?


SDL2 Migration issues that remain:

  - joystick changes (untested)?

 -maybe have a way to have a hidden .time property of every variant, which indicates when it was last changed. To propogate event times from inner to outer stuff.us (tried--doesn't work)

  Picture of balloon for BART
  Gatekeeper task???

Windows:

    * fix getting a pixel color (currently, it crashes)
    * fix setting a pixel color

--------------------------------------------
Possibles FOR 2.0

-standalone seems borked when spaces are used.
-revisit installe issues
-fix vsearch report issues
- vsearch syntax error does not report entire call chain.

* look at gettimeHP stuff to consider a better way.

eyetribe accessibility???

- look into using const Variant & in all functions--this should reduce copying of variants so much.  Overally, need to reduce multiple copying during parsing/execution.

- Test multi-monitor setups for fullscreen, vignetting

  -Fix Inside() so it uses GetAbsolutePosition() (seems to work, except in combinedatafiles.)

 --when default/optional parameters are off-by-one, strange things happened.  Look into EasyTextBox with missing fontsize,etc.
 * Need to generalize running command to permit pebl2.exe, pebl2, etc.

Launcher related:

* textbox cursorline rendersin the wrong place on some fonts (international)

TASKS:


-re-examine running at high priorities on windows
	    
------------------------------------------
todo for 2.0:

 * simplified launcher dialog creation
 * translation dialog


in combinedatafiles, along with sluggish UI for large numbers of files,
 help feedback looks for clicks at the wrong spot (but not on OSX??)

Battery related:

global/local task currently crashes. (fixed, but displays not shown)

-squares filled vs unfilled aren't the same size (maybe AA stuff?)

error in things like ANT, antisaccade:
Resetting rendertarget failed in PlatformPolygon with error code: -1
SDL message: That operation is not supported
<A Polygon :27, 18:


-hebrew translations.
---------------------
PEBL c++ etc

  

MacOS:


sound seems borked on OSX.  See gonogo or oddball or simon task.



##the following crashes (urns.pbl) with syntax error (fixed),linebreak before last )

Bugs/wontfix

  -Error message Rendering failed with error code: -1 (some but not all are fixed).


-errant horizontal line on polygons--look at aiming test
 -possibly be sure thickline is using new sdl_gfx function.


========================================

* figure out plug-in architecture
 * handle space in google drive launcher.
 * Look into  saving audio files issue with 0.14.

* zoomx seems to zoom in both directions. (fixed)
* opspan-when you miss the click for time-out, you get true/false right away and might make an error.

===================================================================
TODO for 0.14

#On page 32 of the 0.14 manual, among codes for keys are listed both
<enter> and <return>, but it seems that only the latter works, can
anyone confirm?




 *Add/fix probedigit
 * flanker task--make neutral version flanked by lines (or at least add the condition) (DONE)
 *switcher task--add debriefing (DONE)
   - move mouse cursor a bit after each click so letter is not obscured. (DONE)

 * setting bgcolor of a window doesn't seem to work; it 
     distorts the color (at least one created with RGBColor) (FIXED)

 * PropertyExists does not seem to work right (workaround with IsProperty in Utility.pbl); (now fixed).

* look at Mueller-lyer illusion for better instructions (they appear not to change; works as intended)
* Look into WritePNG on windows. (fixed)
* Figure out d prime/beta calculation (done)

 * fix/workaround or document font limitation to around 1000 fonts (mostly fixed; limit is now much higher, although not perfect)
 * bring in satest fixes made to enable varying predator size and screen size. (DONE)
 
* (temporary) xy coordinates of objectsmessedup. (fixed)
- Seems to be a problem with setting x/y location of images that are scaled?  (Fixed)

 *TOH output is messed up supposedly. (DONE)
 * Cannot enter | into text box... (fixed)

 *fix subject code text getting blurry. (Done)
 *Incorporate PAR scoring into BCST (DONE)

* Mental Rotation: At least for version 0.11, there was a ton of output that takes (at least for us non-Linux users), a fair amount of post-processing. If it was possible to have a report which has the mean time and percent correct for each angle of rotation, that'd be helpful. (DONE)

* Iowa: The Psychological Assessment Resources version has a brief (500 msec) delay after each selection. This helps to limit the potential that people just respond quick but thoughtlessly. There also is an audio component after each a response (I think it was a "cha-ching" after $ gained, a buzzer after $ lost). (DONE)


 *nback hangs on second block???
 -Runaway crash on demo/NBack.pbl  (maybe with new evaluator)(works now (or does it))

 * Fix GetInput mouse event (DONE)
 * Fix multi-parameter stuff (DONE; removed this; 
                        need to fix the schema file for some test)
  *Add ui for parameter sets files (DONE)

   *getnewdatafile hard-codes gWin instead of win.

Verify:

2) Berg: If it'd be possible to get the mean (or median) response time for each response category, that'd be helpful. Admittedly, I may be the only one interested in these measures but I think there's some interesting info in these end-points that folks haven't considered because it wasn't available for the traditional (physical card) version.
