One of the new shapes is exactly like the previous shape; the other is different, either in size, orientation, or the actual shape of the objects.  Pick the choice that is identical to the previous one.\n\n Press any key to begin absolute identification.",
"INSTINVARIANT": "\n               Invariant Recognition\nIn this task, you will be shown a series of shapes.  Look at each shape and try to remember it as accurately as possible.  The shape will disappear, and shortly afterwards will be replaced by another similar shape.  Try to determine whether the new shape is the same or different from the original. \n\nDecide if the new object is the same as the original one, regardless of its size or orientation.   In other words, the shapes can be the same even if they are different sizes, or are oriented at different angles.  You will be given feedback after each response.\n\nPress any key to begin",
