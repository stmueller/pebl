The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely-used standardized questionnaire for assessing the perceived usability of systems, interfaces, and products. The scale consists of 10 items with five response options from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree". The SUS yields a single score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better usability. This implementation presents each question individually with a visual Likert scale interface, recording both responses and response times for each item.
