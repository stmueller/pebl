"INST": "In this task, you will see one, two, or three cards like the ones below.  Each card has a different chance of predicting sunshine or rain, and based on the cards you see, you need to make a prediction about what the cards predict. Some of the cards are better predictors of a sunny day; others are better predictors of rain. When multiple good predictors of rain are seen together, there is a greater chance of rain, and similarly, when multiple predictors of sun appear together, there is a greater chance of sun.  However, even when the cards indicate a strong chance of rain (or sun) it won't always happen.  Try to learn which cards predict which outcome, and make your best guess on each trial. \nYou will get a point for every prediction you get correct, and lose a point for every prediction you get wrong. Your running points will be shown in the graph to the right.\n\nUse the LEFT response key to predict Rain, and the RIGHT response key to predict Sun.\n\nPress any key to begin.",
