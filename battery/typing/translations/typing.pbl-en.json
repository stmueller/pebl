"INST": "In this task, you will transcription type a passage of text.  The text may or not make any sense, and may not even be in English.  You will see the text to type at the top, and the text you type will appear at the bottom. You cannot correct mistakes you make, so try not to make them.  If you do make a mistake, the cursor will turn red. If the cursor turns red, try to stop and determine what the next letter you should type should be, instead of continuing what you had intended to type, which might be incorrect. Press OK to begin."
