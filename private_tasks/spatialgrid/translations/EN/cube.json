Your drawing should be exactly the same size and shape on both sides.  To make each line, start by clicking on a circle to start drawing, and then click on another circle to complete the line. If you make a mistake, you can click on a line or use the delete button. You must complete the drawing in 2.5 minutes (150s).  When you have drawn all of the parts of the diagram, press OK to complete the test. If you run out of time, you will be allowed to complete one final line.  Click the mouse button to begin.",
