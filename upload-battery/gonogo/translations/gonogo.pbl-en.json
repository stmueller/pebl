    "INST1": "In this task, you will see a series of '<TARG>'s and '<FOIL>'s appear in a grid. Respond ONLY when you see '<TARG>'. DO NOT RESPOND when you see '<FOIL>'. Most letters will be '<TARG>'s.  Below, you can see both the <TARG> and <FOIL> stimuli, but on the real test the letter might be under any of the four stars. You will begin with practice trials where you will receive feedback on errors. When you are ready, make the response shown below to begin practice.",
"INST2": "Now, you will do the task for real. You will no longer be told when you make an error. Make a response to begin the next block.",
"INST3": "You may take a short break before you continue. In the second half of this study, the mapping will reverse. This time, respond ONLY for '<FOIL>', but NOT for '<TARG>'. You will begin with practice trials. Make a response to continue.",
