"INST1": "In this task, you will see and/or hear a series of stimuli.  For each stimulus, you will need to determine whether it was the same as one you saw previously.  To start, we will use one-back as the rule.  So, if a stimulus is identical to one you saw immediately previously, you will respond by hitting the shift key.  We will start with a short practice round.",
"INST2": "Great.  Now, you will try to do the same thing, but ignore the immediately previous trial, and match the stimulus you saw TWO back.  For example, the following stimuli are the ones you should respond to: \n A (NO)\nC (NO)\n A (YES)\n A (NO)\n A (YES)\n To repeat, respond when the stimulus matches the one TWO Back.",
"INST3": "Great.  Now, you will try to do the same thing, but ignore the immediately previous trial, and match the stimulus you saw TWO back.  For example, the following stimuli are the ones you should respond to: \n 1 (NO)\n2 (NO)\n 1 (YES)\n 1 (NO)\n 1 (YES)\n To repeat, respond when the stimulus matches the one TWO Back.",
"INST4": "In addition, you will need to make the same judgment about a second dimension.  In this case, the position indicated in the grid. Let's try a single 1-back round",
"INST5": "Finally, you will need to put these all together. We will start with a dual 1-back task.  In this task, make responses with both the right and left hand, depending on whether each kind of stimulus matches the previous one.",
"TESTBLOCK": "This is a testing block, and your scores will be recorded.  Try to be as accurate as possible. This block will be a <N>-back block.",
