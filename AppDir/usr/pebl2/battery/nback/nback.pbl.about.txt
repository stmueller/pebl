PEBL N-Back Test, with dual N-Back options
Settings allow for either single or dual N-Back with 
a variety of settings, including spatial, by specifiying 
dim1 and dim2, which need to be different. Options:
dim2: squares or none       (dim2 only)

dim1:   "consonants-a"  (Auditory consonants)
  ##  "consonants-v"  (Visual consonants)
  ##  "consonants-av" (both audio and visual)

  ##  "numbers-a"     (auditory numbers)
  ##  "numbers-v"     (visual numbers)
  ##  "numbers-av"     (visual numbers)
  ##  "none"          (either dimension)


Data record:
subnum,block,trial,dim1,dim2,nDim,n,isi,d1,d2,d3,d4,dotext,doaudio,dospatial,timestart,resp1,corr1,time2,rta,resp2,corr2,time3,rtb

subnum: participant code
block: practice/test 1..4
trial: trial within block
dim1, dim2: dimension counting as dim1 and dim2 (i.e., consonants-av should be audio-visual); none=single n-back trial
nDim: 1/2 = single vs dual trial
n= the n-back-ness
isi=intetr-stimulus interval speciication
d1,d2 = design variables. d1/d2 indicate whether there is an n-back match in each dimension
d3/d4 = design variables. d3/d4 indicate the actual stimulus in each dimension.  You can verify that when d1=1, d3 will match the previous trial when n=1.
dotext,doaudio,dospatial = which modalities are turned on/used on this block
timestart = ms time log for start of trial
resp1,corr1=response key/timeout and whether that wase correct for dimension 1
time2 = timestamp  in ms for first dimension response (left key)
rta,=RT for first dimension response (left key)
resp2,corr2,time3,rtb = same things for right key/second response.
