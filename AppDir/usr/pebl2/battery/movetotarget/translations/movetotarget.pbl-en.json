"INST1": "On this task, you try to move your mouse to a location.  At times, it will be easy.  Other times, it will be more difficult, because when you move your mouse one way, it will move the cursor in a different direction.  In those situations, you should try to learn the new mapping--don't try to change the direction the mouse is pointing in to compensate.  At first, you will be bad, but you should improve with practice.  Press OK to begin a practice trial.",
"INST2": "First, we will start with a simple task with normal mouse mapping. Move to the target as quickly as you can.  If you are too slow, the target will disappear and will appear somewhere else. Press OK to begin.",
"INST3": "Now, you do a trial with a different mapping.  Try to move to the target as fast as you can. ",
"INST4": "You may take a brief rest.  Then, you will do another trial with the same mapping as the previous trial.  Press OK to begin.",
